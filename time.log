Major Difficulties:
    The most time-consuming challenges were tinkering
    with regex and figuring out how to do the recursive
    expansion. The REPL was helpful for the former task.
    The major obstacle for the latter task was neglecting
    that WORD could contain unescaped braces prior to its
    expansion (which I had unwittingly assumed in a regex 
    to find the end of the current macro). Prior to 
    realizing that I could use regex to determine whether 
    WORD contained ${...} and simply recurse, I tried 
    to find the end of the current macro by counting 
    open and close braces. Realizing that this problem
    involved code that I had already written led me to
    the simple recursive solution.
